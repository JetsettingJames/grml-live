==================

Name
----
grml-bootsplash - script and configuration framework for the grml system

Synopsis
--------

grml-bootsplash "||..."

About
-----

'grml-bootsplash' provides a text-based simple bootsplash. It is integrated
within the grml-autoconfig(1) framework. You very probably won't need it
otherwise, this manpage just documents what grml-bootsplash does.

Options
-------

The program grml-bootsplash does not support any options besides the "||..."
sequence.  If you want to specify first status of bootsplash use
'grml-bootsplash "|"'.  To specify the last status of bootsplash use
'grml-bootsplash "||||||||||||"' (that's 12 '|').  The maximum number of
supported "|" signs is twelve and will be used automatically if more are
specified.

Bugs
----
If you find a bug please report it. See link:http://grml.org/bugs/ for details
about how to report bugs.
