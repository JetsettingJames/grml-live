Behavior up to grml 2009.05
---------------------------

This section applies to all Grml versions older than and including release 2009.05.

Autoconfiguration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the booting process tries to mount a device labeled 'GRMLCFG'. This
provides the possibility to restore a configuration (named config.tbz) and
execute a script (named grml.sh) without the need to specify any bootparams. If
you want to disable this feature please take a look at the 'noautoconfig'
bootparam.

Boot parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you probably know you can adjust boot parameters on the bootprompt.  You want
to set some boot parameters permanently? That's possible via adding a directory
named 'bootparams' to the Grml-ISO which has to be located at the root-directory
/bootparams/ (note: the directory is known as /live/image/bootparams/ on a
_running_ grml system then). Place a textfile inside the directory containing
the boot parameters which should be appended to default ones (this corresponds
to booting without any special parameters). If you want to be able to boot from
your Grml-CD you have to create a multisession CD. See the <<X7,usage
scenarios>> for more details how to use it or consider booting from a USB device
(checkout grml2usb).

The following boot parameters are supported. Use them at the (isolinux)
bootprompt as documented here.

myconfig::

   This parameter is for restoring configuration using the file config.tbz
    on the specified device. Usage examples:

  myconfig=/dev/sda1                        => use file config.tbz from usb-device
  myconfig=/dev/fd0                         => use file config.tbz from floppy-disk
  myconfig=/dev/sda1 file=config_foobar.tbz => use file config_foobar.tbz from usb-device

home::

    This parameter is for setting a specific partition as home directory.
    Usage examples:

  home=/dev/sda3    =>  use /dev/sda3 as the homepartition
  home=scan         =>  scan through the available partitions and search
                        for file grml.img

partconf::

    This parameter mounts the specified device in read-only mode and tries to
    copy all files specified in /etc/grml/partconf to the Grml system. This
    provides the possibility to use the configuration of a harddisk
    installation. For example using the network configuration (which is
    specified in /etc/network) is possible using this boot parameter. Usage
    example:

  partconf=/dev/sda2 => try to mount /dev/sda2 and copy files specified
                        in /etc/grml/partconf to the booted Grml system

netconfig::

    Use this parameter to restore configuration using wget to download a
    configuration file from specified destination. Usage example:

  netconfig=server.tld/path/to/config.tbz  =>   restore configuration using wget to download file config.tbz

extract::

    Extract specific directories from configuration archive. Notice: This
    bootparam is useful only with bootparams which are able to extract
    configuration archives.

  extract=/home/grml         => extract only /home/grml from archive
  extract=/etc               => extract only /etc from archive
  extract=/home/grml/config  => extract only $HOME/config from archive

scripts::

    This parameter executes a script located in the root-directory /scripts/ on
    the Grml media/ISO (note: the directory is known as /live/image/scripts/ on
    a _running_ Grml system then). Usage examples:

  scripts               =>   run script [/live/image]/scripts/grml.sh
  scripts=foobar.sh     =>   run script foobar.sh in [/live/image]/scripts/

config::

    This parameter restores a configuration using root-directory /config/ on the
    Grml media/ISO (note: the directory is known as /live/image/config on a
    _running_ Grml system then). Usage examples:

  config                    =>   restore configuration using file config.tbz from directory [/live/image]/config/
  config=config_foobar.tbz  =>   restore configuration using file config_foobar.tbz from directory [/live/image]/config/

debs::

    This parameter allows automatic installation of deb packages while booting.
    The debian packages have to be located in the root-directory /debs/ on the
    Grml media/ISO (note: the directory is known as /live/image/debs/ on a
    _running_ Grml system then). Usage examples:

  debs              =>   install all debian packages (suffix .deb) from directory [/live/image]/debs/
  debs=01           =>   install all debian packages (suffix .deb) starting with 01 in the filename from directory [/live/image]/debs/


noautoconfig::

    Deactivate automounting. By default the command 'mount' tries to mount a
    device with label 'GRMLCFG'. If you specify the noautoconfig bootparam the
    automounting will be deactivated.

  noautoconfig            => disables auto mounting of label 'GRMLCFG'
