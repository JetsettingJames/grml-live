grml-etc (0.8-11) unstable; urgency=low

  Notice: the files in /etc/zsh/, /etc/grml/, /etc/apt/, /etc/vim/,
  /etc/grml_*, /etc/network/, /etc/skel/.vim/, /etc/vim/vimrc,
  /etc/skel/.zsh/ and  /etc/skel/.zshrc have been moved to the
  package named grml-etc-core. The package grml-etc-core is meant
  for installation on plain Debian (stable/testing/unstable) systems.
  You don't have to do anything at all, grml-etc depends on package
  grml-etc-core so it will be installed automatically right now.
  If you notice any problems with the move please report it!
