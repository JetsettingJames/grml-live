Welcome to the README of szs2.1.

This is the first (and last) dot release of the second release of szs, a script
for the WMI statusbar.  The name 'szs' is an abbreviation of
Statuszeilenskript, german for statusbar script.

Against szs1st, this release has many more features through its modules.
Now it can show:
* the bandwidth usage of network interfaces     (bandwidth.py)
* the chargingstate of your (laptop-)battery    (battery.py)
* the usage of partitions or diskimages         (diskusage.py)
* if there are mails in an pop or imap account  (biff.py)
* the load average, cpu usage and i/o           (load.py)
* the memory and swap usage                     (memory.py)
* a `date`-like formatted time string           (clock.py)
* freely self configurable bars and texts       (text.py)

To use all this features, look in the good commented config file.
It's named szs.cfg and must be in ~/.wmi or in the same directory as szs.py.

If you want to build own modules read the following files:
 module-developer-reference.txt contains a description how to make modules
 szstoolbox-developer-reference.txt contains the classes/globals of szstoolbox

I hope the script is usable.

Much fun,
Norman Köhring
