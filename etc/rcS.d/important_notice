README - important_notice
=========================

grml does not use sysv-rc but file-rc. If you want to
configure startup of your system just edit the file
/etc/runlevel.conf with $EDITOR. No more symlink hell.

If you find other files than this one (important_notice) in
the /etc/rc{0..6}.d/ /etc/rcS.d directories the software
shipping the initscript does not use the Debian mechansism
update-rc.d to install and activate initscripts and is
broken therefore. Please report it to upstream authors!
