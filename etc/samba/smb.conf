[global]

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d
   printing = cups
   printcap name = cups
   load printers = yes
   guest account = nobody
   invalid users = root

; "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
;	in this server for every user accessing the server.
   security = user

;  bind interfaces only = True
;  interfaces = eth0 1.2.3.4
;  hosts deny = ALL
;  hosts allow = 1.2.3.4/25

; Change this for the workgroup your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = GRML

   server string = %h server (Samba %v)

; If you want Samba to log though syslog only then set the following
;	parameter to 'yes'. Please note that logging through syslog in
;	Samba is still experimental.
   syslog only = no

; We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
;	should go to /var/log/{smb,nmb} instead. If you want to log through
;	syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0;

; This socket options really speed up Samba under Linux, according to my
;	own tests.
; Notice by the grml-team: performance might be *better* without the following
; option so it's deactivated by default!
;   socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY SO_SNDBUF=4096 SO_RCVBUF=4096

; Passwords are encrypted by default. This way the latest Windows 95 and NT
;	clients can connect to the Samba server with no problems.
   encrypt passwords = true
;   passdb backend = smbpasswd

; It's always a good idea to use a WINS server. If you want this server
;	to be the WINS server for your network change the following parameter
;	to "yes". Otherwise leave it as "no" and specify your WINS server
; 	below (note: only one Samba server can be the WINS server).
;	Read BROWSING.txt for more details.
   wins support = no

; If this server is not the WINS server then specify who is it and uncomment
;	next line.
;   wins server = 172.16.0.10

; If we receive WINS server info from DHCP, override the options above. 
;   include = /etc/samba/dhcp.conf

; Please read BROWSING.txt and set the next four parameters according
;	to your network setup. There is no valid default so they are commented
;	out.
;   os level = 0
;   domain master = no
;   local master = no
;   preferred master = no

; What naming service and in what order should we use to resolve host names
;	to IP addresses
   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast

; This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

; Name mangling options

   preserve case = yes
   short preserve case = yes

; This boolean parameter controlls whether Samba attempts to sync. the Unix
;	password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
;	/etc/samba/smbpasswd file is changed.
   unix password sync = false

; For Unix password sync. to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
;	parameters must be set (thanks to Augustin Luton
;	<aluton@hybrigenics.fr> for sending the correct chat script for
;	the passwd program in Debian Potato).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n .

; The following parameter is useful only if you have the linpopup package
;	installed. The samba maintainer and the linpopup maintainer are
;	working to ease installation and configuration of linpopup and samba.
;   message command = /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/linpopup "%f" "%m" %s; rm %s' &

; The default maximum log file size is 5 MBytes. That's too big so this
;	next parameter sets it to 1 MByte. Currently, Samba rotates log
;	files (/var/log/{smb,nmb} in Debian) when these files reach 1000 KBytes.
;	A better solution would be to have Samba rotate the log file upon
;	reception of a signal, but for now on, we have to live with this.
   max log size = 1000
;  debug timestamp = yes
   obey pam restrictions = yes

; Some defaults for winbind (make sure you're not using the ranges
;	for something else.)
;   winbind uid = 10000-20000
;   winbind gid = 10000-20000

;	create files with group=rw permissions, set next parameter to 0775.

; The next two parameters show how to auto-mount a CD-ROM when the
