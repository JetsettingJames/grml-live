Grml - Linux for sysadmins and users of texttools                            09F107
                                                                               
  Further information regarding the Grml live system and available boot        
  options can be found on pages 2 to 10, reachable via keys F2 - F10.          
                                                                               
  Note that the options on page 3 (F3) have to be used as *main* boot          
  options at the bootprompt as they are aliases for further options.           
  The options mentioned on pages 4-9 have to be used as options after the      
  main boot option. If you don't need a special main option just use the       
  default one being 'grml' (which is used in several examples as well).        
  Example:                                                                     
                                                                               
    grml     vga=normal -> disables framebuffer in the default boot mode       
    forensic vga=normal -> disables framebuffer in the forensic boot mode      
                                                                               
  Booting with just "vga=normal" won't work as well as "grml forensic"         
  won't do what you'd expect.                                                  
                                                                               
  Further information available via keys F1...F10.                             
                                                                               
  To return to the graphical boot menu just press ENTER.
