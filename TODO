TODO list for grml-live
-----------------------

Patches, ideas and feedback welcome.

* if a stage fails inside grml-live the stage is skipped on next execution â†’ try
  to find a better way how to clean up the stage and re-execute it again

* support something like a directory $GRML_FAI_CONFIG/chroot_packages to install
  additional Debian packages without the need for a Debian repository

* support multiple kernel versions installed in one single live-system

* Provide different interfaces for easy and common use of grml-live:
  - a console interface (using dialog/stfl/...)
  - a graphical interface (for example using pygtk)
  - a web interface
